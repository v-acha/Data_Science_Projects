Welcome to the Data Science Project repository! This repository showcases my exploration of data science. You can dive into a curated selection of my data science projects, each offering unique insights and analyses across diverse domains. My projects range from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and machine learning applications, all aimed at uncovering meaningful trends, solving problems, and driving informed decision-making. As a beginner, I'm embarking on a journey to learn and grow my skills by working on various projects. I invite you to join me on this learning adventure as I uncover insights, tackle challenges, and build foundational knowledge in data science.

1. [Data Analysis, Salary and Gender Prediction](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/TikTok_Salary_Survey)
   - **Description:** This project entails analyzing salary data gathered from a TikTok survey to predict salary amounts based on various categories and gender, using specific variables as predictors.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data analysis and visualizations. XGBoost for salary prediction and Random Classification for gender prediction.
   - **Results:** The XGBoost regression model achieved an R-squared of 0.60 for predicting salary amounts and The Random Classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.81 for predicting gender.
